# Delphi-Project

## Author: Aleksandar Gakovic

### Introduction
In this project we are answering a set of questions which primarily investigates the data in an SQL table about Football league results. This project emphasies using Object oriented Programming to create and use classes as a key component of the project architecture. This project also introduces the aspect of using an API to gather information about weather which we will want for certain days during certain leagues to answer the questions posed for this investigation.
Finally we Save and load this data into a MongoDB NoSQL Database.



### Summary Methodology
We Access the Data and clean it using SQL
We import it into pandas from there we run some Visualisation
We Access an API for weather information
We Load Data into MongoDB

### Summary Findings
The data suggests that Certain teams won more than others. A visualisation of this can be seen in the project Delphi-Football.ipynb file. 
An attempt at OOP has been made and evidence can be found in the Lib.py file. Although the fruit of the labour was alas, useless I learned somewhat from the failures.
A dataframe of all the teams goals during the 2011 season was made.
However, Weather data has not been added yet in this version.
A mongoDB has not be initialised and data has not been saved to it in this version.

### Conclusion
So far, the project has challenged me to acess, clean and organise data for summary statistics within SQL and I am happy to say that I have good experience doing just that now. The results of the statistics summaries appear to correlate with what my peers have found. The Stacked horizontal bar chart visualising a distribution plot of wins and losses for all teams in the 2011 Division is currently not representative of this data as I am having issues with the stacking aspect. Currently the data appears to overlay incorrectly.
